# WWLayout

## Introduction
There are many options when it comes to building the layout of an iOS app and everyone has their own preferences. The two most popular ways are using Interface Builder and writing out your view in programmatically. Each has their own way of creating view elements and specifying their constraints, one using Storyboards and the other writing everything in code. At WW, we write our views programmatically and specify constraints using a Swift DSL called WWLayout that was written in house by one of our iOS engineers, Steven Grosmark.

Everyone that has built an iOS app using programmatic layouts understands the pains that come with it. Forgetting to add `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false` or forgetting to activate the constraints can cause headaches when your view doesnâ€™t behave as you expect. This comes with a lot of boilerplate code that can end up making your views and view controllers hard to read. A complicated view with multiple elements scattered around the screen will require can add hundreds of lines of code to your project. 

## Quickstart
WWLayout solves this problem by allowing users to write constraints in a readable fashion. WWLayout takes care of all of the boilerplate code that is needed to create views programmatically. You no longer have to toggle the `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` flag or set `isActive = true` for every new element added to your view, as WWLayout handles both of these. 

#### Installation
1. Add `pod 'WWLayout'` to your Podfile.
2. Run `pod install` to install the new pod.
3. Add `import WWLayout` to your file you want to layout views.

#### Usage



WWLayout adds a `layout` property on UIView which is the main point of entry for the library. All constraints will be added after this property: 

`myView.layout.center(in: .superview)`

The layout property holds a reference to the view element which allows for constraints to be chained one after another. Chaining constraints is as simple as: 

`myView.layout.width(300).height(400)`

An example of centering a view element within a parent view is as easy as:
```swift
let button = UIButton()

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    view.addSubview(button)
    button.setTitle("Click me", for: .normal)
    button.setTitleColor(.black, for: .normal)
    button.layout.center(in: .superview)
}
```

A slightly more complicated view with two labels and a button:
```swift
let button = UIButton()
let titleLabel = UILabel()
let subtitleLabel = UILabel()

titleLabel.layout
    .top(to: .superview, offset: 50)
    .centerX(to: .superview)
        
subtitleLabel.layout
    .leading(.greaterOrEqual, to: titleLabel, edge: .trailing, offset: 40, priority: .low)
    .trailing(to: .superview, edge: .trailing, offset: 10, priority: .high)
    .lastBaseline(to: titleLabel)

button.layout
    .below(titleLabel, offset: 30)
    .fillWidth(of: .superview, maximum: 315)
```

Let's break this view down. There are three view elements, a button, and two labels. As you can see, some of the constraints above contain `.superview` as the . WWLayout provides a `.superview` convenience instead of typing out the name of whatever the parent view is.

For `titleLabel`, I'm only constraining the top edge to be 50 off of the top edge of the view and centered horizontally. 

The leading edge of `subtitleLabel` is then constrained to `titleLabel`'s trailing edge with optional parameters for relation set to `.greaterOrEqual` and priority set to `.low`. The trailing edge of `subtitleLabel` is then constrained to the trailing edge of the `.superview`. We mark this priority as `.high` in order to take precedence over the leading edge constraint, which means that the trailing edge constraint will be fulfilled before the leading edge constraint.

Finally, the button is simply constrained to be below `titleLabel` with an `offset` of 30 and it will fill the width of the `.superview` with a maximum width of 315. 

Every function has a number of optional parameters such as `priority`, `relation`, `edge`, `inset`, and `offset`. These optional parameters allow you to 

#### fill()

One function that is incredibly powerful is `fill()`. `fill` comes with a couple optional parameters - `axis:` and `except:`. `axis` allows you to specify that you want your view to fill all available space in either the horizontal `.x` or vertical `.y` plane. `except` allows you to specify that you want the view to fill all available space except for a specified space on the view. I routinely use `fill` to build the views that I work on and it always proves to be useful.

## Conclusion

WWLayout is an incredibly powerful and readable way to write constraints for any type of view. It provides a boost in productivity by reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write in order to construct a view and allows for other maintainers to quickly understand the constraints later on.
